      <code>McDonald's</code>
         was introduced in the Philippines by Chinese-Filipino businessman George Yang, who resided in the United States in the 1970s, though never patronized a McDonald's outlet during his stay. Aware of the fast food chain's success in North America and its increasing presence in other parts of the world, Yang researched fast-food business operations; in 1974, he contacted McDonald's headquarters in Illinois regarding a proposal for rights to open outlets in the Philippines. Yang's proposals were initially ignored, though he continued to remind the company regarding his business interest. In 1976, representatives of McDonald's International sent a delegation to the Philippines to conduct a feasibility study on establishing presence in the Philippine market.

      Chowking was founded by Robert F. Kuan in Rotary Arcade, Makati back in 1985. Unfortunately, he recently passed away in 2018. Because of Chowking’s success in the first few years of operation, it was very quickly franchised and annual sales were passing the million peso mark by 1991. The chain’s growth was aggressive, with 100 stores serving the Chowking menu only a little over a decade after its inception and expanding to international markets.
